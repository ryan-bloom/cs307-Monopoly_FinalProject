__Changes Made__

* Dylan changed the bank to take in
a list of doubles rather than one double.
This is because in our first sprint, we didn't
include buying properties and building on them,
but we are now implementing these abilities in 
Sprint 2. This means the bank needs more information, such
as how many houses there are, etc.
