**Team Contract**

Team Meetings: 
* We agreed to set team meetings each week at the end of the previous team meetings to accommodate changing weekly schedules.
* Policy for missing team meetings: let everyone know at least an hour in advance.  Set a time with at least one of the team members to meet individually and catch up on what you missed. 
* Content of meetings:
    * Update on what people have done since last meeting
    * Break down work for next “sprint” (division of work) 
    * Go over individual plans for how to implement next requirements
    
    
Communications:

* Channel of communication: Facebook
* Within 24 hours, if you won’t be available to answer for a long period of time just let the group know in advance
* Keeping track of to-dos: https://trello.com/invite/b/Ey0KgQdW/837b721543f267a63ea46aa654cd32de/monopoly-team-4 

Helping each other:

* CONFIRMED - we will ask for help when needed.
* CONFIRMED - we will help others with their parts when we think we can help.

Commitments:

* CONFIRMED - we will work to the best of our ability and be timely
* If a teammate is failing to meet their commitments, we will confront them and hold them accountable for their work, but also see how the rest of us can help
* We will reach out to instructors after we attempt to reconcile with our teammate twice and still aren’t successful
